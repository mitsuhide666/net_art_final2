<b> For my art works, I usually use apps in my laptops such as illustrator and photoshop and create image art, also I do sound art, and the tools I use for it are usually my guitar and voice, and out in the audio editing apps such as Audacity and edit the sound with the effects. I can say the sound art is my biggest interests in art since I am also the musician, and it is the art I enjoy making it most. I also prefer making dark art because that is what I am into, and my goal is that I want to make something has very dark like horror movie but by using sounds.
My biggest influence in my art works is music, especially metal music. I always get ideas from music and try it to pull it off as visual art piece. For example, sound art, I make it with my guitar and voice. The difference between making music and making sound art is that music is structured, on the other hand, sound art is very abstract, I use my experience of making music but always trying to make it two completely different things, however music is always the origin of my sound art.
